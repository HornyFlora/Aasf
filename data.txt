Message:-

Dear Students, Teachers, and Parents,

On the momentous occasion of Foundation Day 2024 of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), I extend my heartfelt greetings to each one of you. From its humble beginnings in 1963, KVS has grown into an inspiring institution of excellence in school education. This remarkable journey continues to evolve, driven by an unwavering spirit of innovation and progress.

What began with just 20 regimental schools has now blossomed into a beacon of knowledge, with 1256 schools illuminating the future of our nation. The recent decision by the Government of India to open 85 more Kendriya Vidyalayas underscores the government’s firm commitment to providing accessible and inclusive education to all, further strengthening our nation’s educational framework.

The success of KVS stands as a testament to the dedication, passion, and hard work of every individual associated with it. On this occasion, I express my deepest gratitude to the teachers, staff, and parents whose tireless efforts and invaluable guidance have shaped KVS into the prestigious organization it is today.

This Foundation Day is not just a celebration of an institution; it is a tribute to the bright future of over 13 lakh students, the unshakable dedication of more than 50,000 educators and staff, the trust and support of lakhs of parents, and the cherished memories of our esteemed alumni. Together, we celebrate our shared legacy and the profound impact KVS has had on shaping the future of this nation.

As we commemorate this occasion, let us renew our commitment to setting new benchmarks in school education and nurturing the leaders of tomorrow. I am confident that this journey of service, dedication, and success will continue to unfold, creating a brighter and more promising future for generations to come.

With my best wishes,

(Nidhi Pandey)

During India’s freedom struggle, the great poet of the country, Subramanya Bharati, said that three things are necessary to achieve true independence. First is education; second is education; and third is also education. From Nalanda and Takshila to the present educational system, India’s thousands of years old tradition and culture has always accepted education as a tool through which man makes himself social, civilized and humane. Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan is the torch bearer of this deep tradition of India, which has been successfully carrying out the responsible task of building the country’s new generation with the educational innovations of the modern era while assimilating the age-old traditions in the field of education. The innumerable teachers who give meaning to this penance of making the foundation of the country strong and consistent are the pride and glory of the organization.

jaaka guru bhee andhala, chela khara nirandh
andhai ankau thaaliya, doyun koop paraant।
Come, let us take this saying of Kabir as a warning and move ahead on the path of our duty so that our students can develop in all aspects and the country and society can progress progressively

“Dream, dream, dream! Conduct these dreams into thought, and then transform them into action.”
– A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.
In order to achieve great success in life, surround yourself with positive influences and inspiring stories of people who have achieved their dreams.
Kendriya Vidyalaya, Naval Base Vijayanarayanam has a clear vision and mission that guide their educational philosophy.
Prime focus of the Vidyalaya is to actively engage students in a diverse range of fields beyond just academics.
“Plan, prepare, and perform” is a three-step process for achieving a goal or completing a task effectively.
This involves developing a well-rounded curriculum, promoting innovative teaching methods, and ensuring adequate infrastructure and resources. Implementation of The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, a major reform makes all possibilities in achieving this goal.
As a major transformation, the importance of equipping students with relevant skills is realized which shall add power to the workforce. Hence, we promote vocational training, skill development programs, aligning education with industry needs.
To foster a culture of innovation and research within the education system, we receive support from research institutions like Zonal Institute of Education, collaborating with universities and utilizing new educational technologies.
Education should go beyond academics and help develop well-rounded, responsible citizens. So programs that promote values like tolerance, social responsibility, and environmental awareness are also conducted periodically.
We ensure that every child in our Vidyalaya, regardless of background or location, has access to quality education. We take up the sincere responsibility in shaping the future of the country by ensuring inclusive, high-quality education for all.
Ensuring happy enjoyable learning opportunities and experiences!.
