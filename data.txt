75 Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA)

Cabinet approves opening of 85 new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) under civil/defence sector across the country and expansion of one existing KV i.e. KV Shivamogga, Karnataka by adding 2 additional sections in all the classes

Posted On: 06 DEC 2024 8:01PM by PIB Delhi

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has approved opening of 85 new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) under Civil/Defence sector across the country and expansion of one existing KV i.e. KV Shivamogga, District Shivamogga, Karnataka to facilitate increased number of Central Government employees by adding two additional Sections in all the classes under the Kendriya Vidyalaya Scheme (Central Sector Scheme). The list of these 86 KVs is annexed.

The total estimated requirement of funds for establishment of the 85 new KVs and expansion of 01 existing nearby KV is Rs. 5872.08 crore (approx.) spread over a period of eight years from 2025-26. This includes capital expenditure component of Rs. 2862.71 crore (approx.) and operational expenditure of Rs. 3009.37 crore (approx.).           

As on date, there are 1256 functional KVs, including 03 abroad viz. Moscow, Kathmandu and Tehran and a total number of 13.56 lakh (approx.) students are studying in these KVs.   

The administrative structure for implementing the project will require creation of posts at par with the norms fixed by the Sangathan for running of one full fledged KV with a capacity of approximately 960 students. Hence, 960 X 86 = 82560 students would benefit. As per norms in vogue, a full-fledged Kendriya Vidyalaya provides employment to 63 persons and accordingly, approval of 85 new KVs and the expansion of one existing nearby KV, which will add 33 new posts, a total of 5,388 direct permanent employment opportunities will be created. Construction and allied activities associated with augmentation of various facilities in all KVs are likely to generate employment opportunities for many skilled and unskilled workers.

The Government of India approved the Scheme of Kendriya Vidyalayas in November 1962 to provide educational facilities of uniform standard throughout the country for the children of transferable Central Government/Defence employees. Consequently, "Central Schools Organization" was started as a unit of the Ministry of Education of the Government of India. Initially, 20 Regimental Schools in Defence Stations were taken over as Central Schools during the Academic Year 1963-64.

Kendriya Vidyalayas are primarily opened to cater to educational needs of wards of transferable and non-transferable employees of Central Government including Defence and Paramilitary forces and for children of floating population and others including those living in remote and undeveloped locations in the country.

In pursuance of the National Education Policy 2020, almost all Kendriya Vidyalayas have been designated as PM Shri schools, showcasing the implementation of NEP 2020 and acting as exemplar Schools for others. The KVs are some of the most sought after schools, due to their quality teaching, innovative pedagogy and up-to-date infrastructure. There has been continuous increase in the number of students applying for admission to class I in KVs every year and the performance of the students of the Kendriya Vidyalayas in the board examinations conducted by CBSE has consistently been the best among all educational systems.

[Ministry of Finance Notification dated 31st January 2019]

F. No.1/3/2016-PR - In partial modification of para 1(i) of Ministry of Finance's Gazette Notification No. 5/7/2003-ECB-PR dated 22nd December, 2003, based on the Government's decision on 6th December, 2018 on the recommendations of "Committee setup to suggest measures for streamlining the implementation of National Pension System (NPS)", the Central Government makes the following amendments in the said notification, namely:-

(1) In para 1(i) of the said notification, for the words "The monthly contribution would be 10 percent of the salary and DA to be paid by the employee and matched by the Central Government", the words "The monthly contribution would be 10 percent of the Basic Pay plus Dearness Allowance (DA) to be paid by the employee and 14 percent of the Basic Pay plus DA by the Central Government" shall be substituted.

(2) The following provisions shall be inserted after para 1(v) of the said notification, namely:-

CHOICE OF PENSION FUND AND INVESTMENT PATTERN IN TIER-I OF NPS AS UNDER:

(vi) Choice of Pension Fund: As in the case of subscribers in the private sector, the Government subscribers may also be allowed to choose any one of the pension funds including Private sector pension funds. They could change their option once in a year. However, the current provision of combination of the Public-Sector Pension Funds will be available as the default option for both existing as well as new Government subscribers.

(vii) Choice of Investment pattern: The following options for investment choices may be offered to Government employees:

(a) The existing scheme in which funds are allocated by the PFRDA among the three Public Sector Undertaking fund managers based on their past performance in accordance with the guidelines of PFRDA for Government employees may continue as default scheme for both existing and new subscribers.

(b) Government employees who prefer a fixed return with minimum amount of risk may be given an option to invest 100% of the funds in Government securities (Scheme G).

(c) Government employees who prefer higher returns may be given the options of the following two Life Cycle based schemes:

(A) Conservative Life Cycle Fund with maximum exposure to equity capped at 25%-LC-25.

(B) Moderate Life Cycle Fund with maximum exposure to equity capped at 50%-LC-50.

(viii) Implementation of choices to the legacy corpus: Transfer of a large legacy corpus of more than Rs. 1 lakh crore in respect of the Government sector subscribers from the existing Pension Fund Managers is likely to impact the market. It may be practically difficult for the PFRDA to allow Government subscribers to change the Pension Funds or investment pattern in respect of the accumulated corpus, in one go. Therefore, for the present, change in the Pension Funds or investment pattern may be allowed in respect of incremental flows only.

(ix) Transfer of legacy corpus in a reasonable time frame: PFRDA may draw up a scheme for transfer of accumulated corpus as per new choices of Government subscribers in a reasonable time frame of say five years. Once PFRDA draws up this scheme, change in the Pension Funds or investment pattern may be allowed in respect of the accumulated corpus in accordance with that scheme.

COMPENSATION FOR NON-DEPOSIT OR DELAYED DEPOSIT OF CONTRIBUTIONS DURING 2004-2012:

(x) In all cases where the NPS contributions were deducted from the salary of the Government employee but the amount was not remitted to CRA system or was remitted late, the amount may be credited to the NPS account of the employee along with interest for the period from the date on which the deductions were made till the date the amount was credited to the NPS account of the employee, as per the rates applicable to GPF from time to time, compounded annually.

(xi) In all cases where the NPS contributions were not deducted from the salary of the Government employee for any period during 2004-2012, the employee may be given an option to deposit the amount of employee contribution now. In case he opts to deposit the contribution now, the amount may be deposited in one lump sum or in monthly installments. The amount of installment may be deducted from the salary of the Government employee and deposited in his NPS account. The same may qualify for tax concessions under the Income Tax Act as applicable to the mandatory contributions of the employee.

(xii) In all cases where the Government contributions were not remitted to CRA system or were remitted late (irrespective whether the employee contributions were deducted or not), the amount of Government contributions may be credited to the NPS account of the employee along with interest for the period from the date on which the Government contributions were due till the date the amount is actually credited to the NPS account of the employee, as per the rates applicable to GPF from time to time. Instructions to this effect may be issued by the Department of Expenditure/Controller General of Accounts. All such cases of delay may be resolved within a period of three months.

2. The above provisions shall come into force with effect from 1st April, 2019.


[PFRDA Circular dated 15th February 2021]

The above arrangements are applicable with immediate effect from the date of issuance of this circular.

[PFRDA Circular dated 1st June 2020]

Subject: Choice of Pension Funds and Investment Pattern in Tier I of NPS for the Government subscribers employed with State Governments (SG), State Autonomous Bodies (SABs) & Central Autonomous Bodies (CABs)

A. This has reference to the Gazette Notification F. No.1/3/2016-PR dated 31-01-2019 issued by Dept. of Financial Service (DFS), Ministry of Finance (MoF), pursuant to which the Authority vide its circular no PFRDA/2019/12/REG-PF/1 dated 08th May 2019, introduced the choice of the pension fund and investment pattern in the Tier I of the NPS for the employees of the Central Government.

B. The following were introduced by Central Government through the DFS Gazette Notification (Annexure 1) mentioned supra:

I. Enhancement in Government Co-Contribution - The monthly contribution of 10 percent of the Basic Pay plus Dearness Allowance (DA) to be paid by the employee and 14 percent of the Basic Pay plus DA by the Central Government.

II. Compensation For Non-Deposit Or Delayed Deposit Of Contributions in the following cases:

1. where the NPS contributions were deducted from the salary of the Government employee but the amount was not remitted to CRA system or was remitted late;
2. where the NPS contributions were not deducted from the salary of the Government employee;
3. where the Government contributions were not remitted to CRA system or were remitted late (irrespective whether the employee contributions were deducted or not).


III. Choice of Pension Fund And Investment Pattern In Tier-I Of NPS as under:

1. Choice of Pension Fund: The Government subscribers shall be allowed to choose any one of the pension funds including Private sector pension funds. They can change their option once in a year. However, the current provision of combination of Public Sector pension Funds will be available as default option for existing as well as new Government subscriber.
2. Choice of Investment Pattern: The following options for investment choices shall be offered to Government subscribers:
(i) Default Scheme: The existing scheme in which funds are allocated among three Public Sector undertaking fund managers shall continue as default scheme for both existing and new subscribers.

The Government subscribers may exercise one of the above choices of Investment pattern twice in a financial year.

IV. Implementation of choices to the legacy corpus: Transfer of large legacy corpus in respect of the Government subscribers from the existing Pension Funds is likely to impact the market. It may be practically difficult for the PFRDA to allow Government subscribers to change the Pension Funds or investment pattern in respect of the accumulated corpus, in one go. Therefore, for the present, change in the Pension Funds or investment pattern is allowed in respect of the incremental flows only.

V. Transfer of Legacy corpus in reasonable time frame: PFRDA shall draw up a scheme in due course for transfer of accumulated corpus as per new choices of Government subscribers in a reasonable time frame of say five years.

Sector (CG & SG), Corporate CG, NPS Lite and APY) and subsequent amendments made thereto shall apply.

C. It has been brought to the notice of the Authority that while some of the State Governments (SGs) / SABs/ CABs have either partially or wholly adopted the provisions of Gazette Notification F.

[Ministry of Finance Notification dated 31st January 2019]

F. No.1/3/2016-PR - In partial modification of para 1(i) of Ministry of Finance's Gazette Notification No. 5/7/2003-ECB-PR dated 22nd December, 2003, based on the Government's decision on 6th December, 2018 on the recommendations of "Committee setup to suggest measures for streamlining the implementation of National Pension System (NPS)", the Central Government makes the following amendments in the said notification, namely:-

(1) In para 1(i) of the said notification, for the words "The monthly contribution would be 10 percent of the salary and DA to be paid by the employee and matched by the Central Government", the words "The monthly contribution would be 10 percent of the Basic Pay plus Dearness Allowance (DA) to be paid by the employee and 14 percent of the Basic Pay plus DA by the Central Government" shall be substituted.

(2) The following provisions shall be inserted after para 1(v) of the said notification, namely:-

CHOICE OF PENSION FUND AND INVESTMENT PATTERN IN TIER-I OF NPS AS UNDER:

(vi) Choice of Pension Fund: As in the case of subscribers in the private sector, the Government subscribers may also be allowed to choose any one of the pension funds including Private sector pension funds. They could change their option once in a year. However, the current provision of combination of the Public-Sector Pension Funds will be available as the default option for both existing as well as new Government subscribers.

(vii) Choice of Investment pattern: The following options for investment choices may be offered to Government employees:

(a) The existing scheme in which funds are allocated by the PFRDA among the three Public Sector Undertaking fund managers based on their past performance in accordance with the guidelines of PFRDA for Government employees may continue as default scheme for both existing and new subscribers.

(b) Government employees who prefer a fixed return with minimum amount of risk may be given an option to invest 100% of the funds in Government securities (Scheme G).

(c) Government employees who prefer higher returns may be given the options of the following two Life Cycle based schemes:

(A) Conservative Life Cycle Fund with maximum exposure to equity capped at 25%-LC-25.

(B) Moderate Life Cycle Fund with maximum exposure to equity capped at 50%-LC-50.

(viii) Implementation of choices to the legacy corpus: Transfer of a large legacy corpus of more than Rs. 1 lakh crore in respect of the Government sector subscribers from the existing Pension Fund Managers is likely to impact the market. It may be practically difficult for the PFRDA to allow Government subscribers to change the Pension Funds or investment pattern in respect of the accumulated corpus, in one go. Therefore, for the present, change in the Pension Funds or investment pattern may be allowed in respect of incremental flows only.

(ix) Transfer of legacy corpus in a reasonable time frame: PFRDA may draw up a scheme for transfer of accumulated corpus as per new choices of Government subscribers in a reasonable time frame of say five years. Once PFRDA draws up this scheme, change in the Pension Funds or investment pattern may be allowed in respect of the accumulated corpus in accordance with that scheme.

COMPENSATION FOR NON-DEPOSIT OR DELAYED DEPOSIT OF CONTRIBUTIONS DURING 2004-2012:

(x) In all cases where the NPS contributions were deducted from the salary of the Government employee but the amount was not remitted to CRA system or was remitted late, the amount may be credited to the NPS account of the employee along with interest for the period from the date on which the deductions were made till the date the amount was credited to the NPS account of the employee, as per the rates applicable to GPF from time to time, compounded annually.

(xi) In all cases where the NPS contributions were not deducted from the salary of the Government employee for any period during 2004-2012, the employee may be given an option to deposit the amount of employee contribution now. In case he opts to deposit the contribution now, the amount may be deposited in one lump sum or in monthly installments. The amount of installment may be deducted from the salary of the Government employee and deposited in his NPS account. The same may qualify for tax concessions under the Income Tax Act as applicable to the mandatory contributions of the employee.

(xii) In all cases where the Government contributions were not remitted to CRA system or were remitted late (irrespective whether the employee contributions were deducted or not), the amount of Government contributions may be credited to the NPS account of the employee along with interest for the period from the date on which the Government contributions were due till the date the amount is actually credited to the NPS account of the employee, as per the rates applicable to GPF from time to time. Instructions to this effect may be issued by the Department of Expenditure/Controller General of Accounts. All such cases of delay may be resolved within a period of three months.

2. The above provisions shall come into force with effect from 1st April, 2019.

'पुस्तकोपहार' कार्यक्रम के तहत केन्द्रीय विद्यालयों में हर वर्ष अप्रैल माह के दौरान एक अनोखा और भावनात्मक आयोजन होता है। इस वर्ष भी, वरिष्ठ कक्षा के विद्यार्थियों ने अपने पाठ्यपुस्तकों को कनिष्ठ विद्यार्थियों को उपहार स्वरूप वितरित किया। इस कार्यक्रम के माध्यम से न सिर्फ किताबों का पुन: उपयोग होता है, बल्कि इससे किताबों पर होने वाले खर्च में भी बचत होती है, इसी के साथ, विद्यार्थियों के बीच सामुदायिक साझेदारी की भावना, जिम्मेदारी, और नैतिक मूल्यों का भी विकास होता है। 'पुस्तकोपहार' कार्यक्रम पर्यावरण संरक्षण की दिशा में भी एक मिसाल है, जो संसाधनों के पुनर्चक्रण और सतत विकास को प्रोत्साहित करता है। इस प्रकार, 'पुस्तकोपहार' पुस्तकों का उपहार ही नहीं है, बल्कि यह विद्यार्थियों के बीच प्रेम, सहयोग, सहानुभूति और पर्यावरण सुरक्षा का सजीव उदाहरण है।

केन्द्रीय विद्यालय संगठन द्वारा वर्ष 2018 से हर वर्ष कक्षा 10वीं की बोर्ड परीक्षाओं के उपरांत विद्यार्थियों की छुट्टियों का सार्थक उपयोग करने के लिए 'तरुणोत्सव' कार्यक्रम आयोजित किया जाता है। इस वर्ष भी तरुणोत्सव के दौरान कार्यक्रम के माध्यम से विद्यालय में अनेक गतिविधियां करवाई गई जैसे भाषा कौशल सुधार (अंग्रेजी और हिंदी दोनों), करियर निर्देशन, विद्यार्थियों को उनकी रूचि अनुसार मार्गदर्शन और कक्षा 11वीं के विषयों का भी परिचय देना। 'तरुणोत्सव' का उद्देश्य विद्यार्थियों के व्यक्तित्व विकास को प्रोत्साहित करना और उन्हें उनके उज्जवल भविष्य के लिए तैयार करना है, जिससे वे अपने करियर की दिशा में सशक्त कदम उठा सकें।

खुशनुमा वातावरण में शिक्षा का आरंभ

इस कार्यक्रम में, बच्चों के लिए तनाव-मुक्त वातावरण में विभिन्न गतिविधियां कराई गई, जिससे उनकी विद्यालय आने की जिज्ञासा और उत्साह बढ़े। 'विद्या प्रवेश' ने बच्चों को एक सुरक्षित और सहयोगपूर्ण माहौल प्रदान किया, ताकि उनकी शैक्षिक यात्रा सुखद और सफल हो सके।

This initiative provided Science and Mathematics teachers with an enriching opportunity to visit the IISER Mohali campus, where they explored cutting-edge laboratories and discovered the latest innovative technologies, igniting their passion for teaching and inspiring a new wave of scientific curiosity.

To cultivate the managerial skills and leadership qualities of newly appointed principals, induction courses were held at five Zonal Institutes of Education & Technology. In a testament to her commitment to excellence, Ms. Nidhi Pandey, the Commissioner of KVS, made personal visits to some of the venues. There, she evaluated the quality of the courses and shared her invaluable insights, ensuring that these leaders are well-prepared to guide their institutions toward success.

Their unwavering dedication and tireless work ethic have propelled KVS to the summit of school education in India. With the recent addition of over 10,000 teachers, the organization stands on the brink of a new era, where equipping these educators with the ethos and aspirations of KVS is essential. To nurture this new wave of educators, 103 induction courses (in blended mode) were thoughtfully organized between April and June 2024, laying the foundation for a bright future in education. This mammoth task was accomplished with the coordination of ZIETs and Regional Offices, where common course designs were formulated for standardization and uniformity.

In-service courses for teachers are a cornerstone of the KVS training program, designed to keep educators at the forefront of pedagogical innovation and educational technology. These courses equip teachers with the latest tools and techniques, empowering them to guide students toward success in an increasingly competitive world.

From its humble beginnings in 1963, KVS has grown into an inspiring institution of excellence in school education. This remarkable journey continues to evolve, driven by an unwavering spirit of innovation and progress.

What began with just 20 regimental schools has now blossomed into a beacon of knowledge, with 1256 schools illuminating the future of our nation. The recent decision by the Government of India to open 85 more Kendriya Vidyalayas underscores the government’s firm commitment to providing accessible and inclusive education to all, further strengthening our nation’s educational framework.

The success of KVS stands as a testament to the dedication, passion, and hard work of every individual associated with it. On this occasion, I express my deepest gratitude to the teachers, staff, and parents whose tireless efforts and invaluable guidance have shaped KVS into the prestigious organization it is today.

This Foundation Day is not just a celebration of an institution; it is a tribute to the bright future of over 13 lakh students, the unshakable dedication of more than 50,000 educators and staff, the trust and support of lakhs of parents, and the cherished memories of our esteemed alumni.

During India’s freedom struggle, the great poet of the country, Subramanya Bharati, said that three things are necessary to achieve true independence. First is education; second is education; and third is also education. From Nalanda and Takshila to the present educational system, India’s thousands of years old tradition and culture has always accepted education as a tool through which man makes himself social, civilized and humane. Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan is the torch bearer of this deep tradition of India, which has been successfully carrying out the responsible task of building the country’s new generation with the educational innovations of the modern era while assimilating the age-old traditions in the field of education. The innumerable teachers who give meaning to this penance of making the foundation of the country strong and consistent are the pride and glory of the organization.

jaaka guru bhee andhala, chela khara nirandh
andhai ankau thaaliya, doyun koop paraant।

“Dream, dream, dream! Conduct these dreams into thought, and then transform them into action.”
– A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.
In order to achieve great success in life, surround yourself with positive influences and inspiring stories of people who have achieved their dreams.
Kendriya Vidyalaya, Naval Base Vijayanarayanam has a clear vision and mission that guide their educational philosophy.
Prime focus of the Vidyalaya is to actively engage students in a diverse range of fields beyond just academics.
“Plan, prepare, and perform” is a three-step process for achieving a goal or completing a task effectively.
This involves developing a well-rounded curriculum, promoting innovative teaching methods, and ensuring adequate infrastructure and resources. Implementation of The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, a major reform makes all possibilities in achieving this goal.
As a major transformation, the importance of equipping students with relevant skills is realized which shall add power to the workforce. Hence, we promote vocational training, skill development programs, aligning education with industry needs.
To foster a culture of innovation and research within the education system, we receive support from research institutions like Zonal Institute of Education, collaborating with universities and utilizing new educational technologies.
Education should go beyond academics and help develop well-rounded, responsible citizens. So programs that promote values like tolerance, social responsibility, and environmental awareness are also conducted periodically.
We ensure that every child in our Vidyalaya, regardless of background or location, has access to quality education. We take up the sincere responsibility in shaping the future of the country by ensuring inclusive, high-quality education for all.
Ensuring happy enjoyable learning opportunities and experiences!.
