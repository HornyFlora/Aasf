Nipun Lakshay
NIPUN (National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy), a programme launched by the Ministry of Education aims at consolidating foundational learning in students up to grade 3. Our school PM SHRI Kendriya Vidyalaya Vijayanarayanam has taken effective measures in equipping teachers with necessary teaching learning material, assessment worksheets, etc. to help make learning joyful and all inclusive, thereby strengthening foundational competence amongst children in the age bracket of 3 to 9 years.
Each and every month we conduct NIPUN meetings at vidyalaya level and discuss innovative teaching learning ideas and TLMs to achieve the lakshayas successfully. We plan activities and strategies according to the split up syllabus and NIPUN goals and ensure the successfully completion of planned activities.
KVS also conduct Cluster Level NIPUN meeting every quarter which enables us to exchange the ideas and resolve the issues to achieve NIPUN goals.

Fun Day - https://cdnbbsr.s3waas.gov.in/s3kv0252e06722e50b20dae5701e6a57fb/uploads/2024/04/2024042373.svg - https://vijayanarayanam.kvs.ac.in/fun-day/:

Fun day can be as simple as having a party in the classroom or gymnasium. Activities for fun days involving younger students should be appropriate to their age. Direct young students in classic games like Pin the Tail on the Donkey, bobbing for apples,three-legged races,dance,music, origami, drawing and painting, toy making or favourite activities of tiny tots etc.
We conduct it every Saturday of the week as per the instructions of KVS HQ Delhi. We prepare a fresh timetable for each and every Funday. All the concerned teachers submit the pictures of all the planned activities and we prepare records for the same in a separate Funday activities register. We also include FlN activities during the Funday timetable as per the instructions of Mr. Vellaichamy, Assistant Commissioner, RO Chennai during annual panel inspection 03rd Nov 2023.
