Nipun Lakshay
NIPUN (National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy), a programme launched by the Ministry of Education aims at consolidating foundational learning in students up to grade 3. Our school PM SHRI Kendriya Vidyalaya Vijayanarayanam has taken effective measures in equipping teachers with necessary teaching learning material, assessment worksheets, etc. to help make learning joyful and all inclusive, thereby strengthening foundational competence amongst children in the age bracket of 3 to 9 years.
Each and every month we conduct NIPUN meetings at vidyalaya level and discuss innovative teaching learning ideas and TLMs to achieve the lakshayas successfully. We plan activities and strategies according to the split up syllabus and NIPUN goals and ensure the successfully completion of planned activities.
KVS also conduct Cluster Level NIPUN meeting every quarter which enables us to exchange the ideas and resolve the issues to achieve NIPUN goals.
